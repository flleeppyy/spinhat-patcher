# Notice!

I've decided to not continue on with this project, despite how much effort I've put into it. It was a nice idea, but if there's anyone else out there who might be willing to take on this project, please let me know.

I gave up on this because I had spoken to a few of the developers behind Reason+, and I didn't get any negative feedback, but something about it just demotivated me to work on it. I might occasionally work on this if I'm so bored out of my mind and have nothing to do (Which is very likely)

# Requirements

You must have the following installed

- [Node.js 16.13.2 or greater/w npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/)

- [pnpm v6 or greater](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm)
-- You can run `npm i -g pnpm` to install pnpm globally.

## Todo

- [ ] Make child_process not freeze the render loop
- [ ] Add settings menu for proxys, and custom development folder to patch.
